Bussard ramjet is one of my favorite pieces of theoretical engineering,
but with great sorrow, I must say that it is most likely not a feasible
method for interstellar propulsion UNLESS we make miracles come true.

By the time we make those miracles come true however, we probably
will already have come up with better propulsion techniques, and that
could defeat the purpose of constructing a Bussard ramjet.

Regardless, I hope the later generations don't just throw the design
into the trash bin. It is a crazy idea to make starships which propel
themselves in a space-breathing fashion.
